I gave up on organizing Git repositories for competitive programming problems I've solved, so this will just hold all problems I've solved between all platforms I use and all other resources (e.g, playing with pointers, books, etc.).

Planning to make most of them C++, so just run `g++ {problem}.cpp -Wall && ./a.out` and you should be golden.
